# shuttr 📸
  
Have you ever wanted to take amazing photos but don’t know where to go to take them? 
We have the solution for you.
We wanted to build an innovative app for the creatives who love to take aesthetic photos but did not know where the prime locations were. 
Shutter allows users to build a community where they can discover pins around London, explore hashtags you are interested in, run location searches, share your own photos and view other pins on a map.

## Planning and Approach
### User Stories

```
As a user 
so that I can find interesting locations
I would like to sign up to the website
```
```
As a user 
Because I would like to be able to access my account 
I would like to login.
```
```
As a user
So I can be part of the community 
I would like to be able to upload photos
```
```
As a user 
So I can see where the hotspots are
I would like to be able to see the locations of the photos
```
```
As an avid creative
So I can be exposed to new genres
I would like to view the photos sorted by hashtags
```
```
As a user 
So I can see everything I posted
I would like to see everything I've posted 
```
```
As a wanderer
So I can see where I'm heading 
I would like to see the locations pinned on a map
```
###  Stretch Goals

```
As a user 
So I can be on the leaderboard 
I would like my photos to earn points
```
```
As a social media king
So I can get my photos on the homepage
When a user spends time on my photo I would like it to rank high
```
```
As a user 
So that I can gain more content
When I level up I would like to unlock new features on the map
```
